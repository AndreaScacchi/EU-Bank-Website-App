# EU-Bank-Website-App

This is a fake bank website with the fake bank app into it. 

## Tools
I've used *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript* to build this project. Moreover, I used the DOM to create many functionalities, like dynamic scrolling into sections, sticky navbar, back to top button and more.

## The app

I created the app for fake users, to take a loan, transfer money, delete account, etc. You need to login into the app to use this functionalities.
